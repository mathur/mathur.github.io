The constellations are never wrong. Being in the Milky Way Galaxy means that we can be hypnotised pretty easily. Itâ€™s also the reason as to why hypnosis is such an interesting entertainment act. We shower successful hypnotists with money, but they would have no career if Earth existed in another galaxy.

A possible reason that hypnosis works in bringing back some memories of alien abduction is that hypnosis after abduction actually partially reverts hypnosis performed during abduction.
